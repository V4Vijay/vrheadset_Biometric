Functional Requirements for VR Headset Retina Lock/Unlock
These requirements describe what the system must do from a user's perspective.
User Registration (Retina Scan Enrollment):
FR1.1: Initial Setup: The system shall allow a user to register their retina for initial setup. This process should be initiated by the user through a clear in-VR interface.
FR1.2: Retina Scan Capture: During registration, the system shall utilize the headset's camera (if available and capable) to capture a scan of the user's retina.
FR1.3: Data Storage (Secure): The captured retina scan data shall be stored securely on the device. (Note: For a simplified example, we'll use local storage, but in a real-world scenario, this would require robust encryption and secure enclave storage.)
FR1.4: Registration Confirmation: Upon successful registration, the system shall provide visual and/or auditory feedback to the user confirming successful retina enrollment.
FR1.5: Re-registration Option: The system shall allow the user to re-register their retina if needed (e.g., initial scan was poor, user wants to update).
Headset Locking:
FR2.1: Automatic Locking (On Headset Removal): The system shall automatically lock the headset when it detects that the headset has been removed from the user's head (using proximity sensors or similar).
FR2.2: Manual Locking (User Initiated): The system shall provide a manual locking mechanism accessible through the VR interface, allowing the user to lock the headset at any time.
FR2.3: Lock State Indication: When locked, the headset shall clearly indicate its locked state to anyone attempting to use it (e.g., a lock screen in VR).
Headset Unlocking (Retina Scan Authentication):
FR3.1: Retina Scan Initiation on Unlock Attempt: When a user attempts to use a locked headset, the system shall automatically initiate a retina scan.
FR3.2: Real-time Retina Scan: The system shall use the headset's camera to perform a real-time retina scan of the user currently wearing the headset.
FR3.3: Retina Data Comparison: The system shall compare the real-time scan with the securely stored registered retina data.
FR3.4: Successful Authentication (Unlock): If the real-time scan matches the registered retina data within an acceptable tolerance, the system shall successfully authenticate the user and unlock the headset, allowing normal VR operation.
FR3.5: Failed Authentication (Lock Remains): If the real-time scan does not match the registered retina data, the system shall fail authentication, the headset shall remain locked, and the system shall provide feedback to the user indicating authentication failure (e.g., "Retina scan failed. Please try again.").
FR3.6: Retry Mechanism: The system shall allow the user to retry the retina scan authentication multiple times.
FR3.7: Fallback Unlock Mechanism (Optional but Recommended): (For robustness, a fallback like a PIN or password unlock would be highly recommended in a real system, but for simplicity in this example, we'll omit it.)
User Feedback and Interface:
FR4.1: Visual Cues during Scan: The system shall provide clear visual cues to guide the user during the retina scan process (e.g., instructions to look at the camera, progress indicators).
FR4.2: Authentication Status Feedback: The system shall provide immediate visual and/or auditory feedback to the user indicating whether the retina scan authentication was successful or failed.
FR4.3: In-VR Settings Menu: The system's settings (registration, re-registration, lock/unlock status, etc.) shall be accessible through a user-friendly in-VR menu.
Security Considerations:
FR5.1: Secure Data Storage: Registered retina data must be stored using strong encryption to prevent unauthorized access. (Simplified example will use basic file storage, but real systems need robust security.)
FR5.2: Liveness Detection (Ideal): Ideally, the system should incorporate liveness detection to prevent spoofing with static retina images or videos. (Beyond the scope of a simple example, but important for real security.)
FR5.3: Protection Against Replay Attacks: The system should be designed to prevent replay attacks where recorded authentication data is used to bypass security. (Again, more complex for a basic example.)
Simplified Python Code Example (Conceptual)
**Important Notes:**
This is a highly simplified, conceptual example in Python. It does not perform actual retina scanning. Real retina scanning requires specialized hardware and algorithms.
This code is designed to be run on a computer, NOT directly on the Meta Quest headset. Running Python directly on Quest requires more setup (see SideQuest installation notes below).
Security is extremely basic. Real retina authentication systems are far more complex and secure.
This example simulates the logic of locking and unlocking based on a simple "retina data" comparison.
